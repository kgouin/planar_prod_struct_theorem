# An Implementation of the Product Structure Theorem for Planar Graphs
This implements the optimal algorithm described in [arXiv:2202.08870](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.08870.pdf).

For a detailed description of planar product structure decompositions and product structure theorem in relation to queue layouts, please refer to the document 'thesis.pdf'.
